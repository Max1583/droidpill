            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                Adobe launched its vector app <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/draw.html" class="links">Adobe
                    Illustrator</a> Draw on Android back in 2016, but even now it is virtually the only credible way to
                create vector drawings on a mobile device (unless you opt for a Windows-toting tablet). Illustrator Draw
                will be familiar to anyone used to its desktop sibling, and it doesn't scrimp on features, with
                configurable pen tips, layers, merge options, and more.
            </p>
            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                Adobe Illustrator Draw has a sleek and simplified interface that is approachable for new mobile artists,
                but also robust enough for the seasoned illustrator to be considered
            </p>

                <a href="https://www.canva.com/websites/templates/" class="links">Canva</a> is a versatile graphic
                design tool that runs in your browser and as an app on Android and iOS: it lets you create brochures,
                flyers, posters, social media graphics, invitations, calendars, videos, presentations, cards, logos,
                infographics, labels, letterheads, resumes, menus and more. You can start off with a template or a
                completely blank slate, and build your design up however you want.
            </p>
            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                The platform includes an impressive number of editing and layout tools as well â€“ covering everything
                from image cropping to blur effects to background removal. Objects can be easily arranged and layered in
                a project, and it's straightforward to add extras like text captions or fun stickers on top of whatever
                you're doing.
            </p>
            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                Canva prides itself on being simple to use for anyone, with or without graphic design experience, and
                it's certainly true that the templates and intuitive tools mean you can create something very
                professional-looking very quickly.

            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                When you first open PicsArt, the visually busy community home page is displayed, and it might take a few
                moments for a new user to wade through all the buttons to figure out what to do first.
            </p>

            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                PicsArt's photo-editing module is as comprehensive as you can get in an app intended for the general
                market. PicsArt's clean, easy-to-understand photo editing gives savvy users lots of creative control
                (including the ability to brush effects onto selected areas of your picture) while being transparent
                enough for novices to experiment successfully.

            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                <a href=" " class="links"> PicsArt</a> has long had a nice selection of stickers. Now you can create
                custom stickers from your photos, such as a sticker of a flower you photographed, or your friend's head.

            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                PicArts' biggest new feature is Remix, which adds a lively dimension of social photo editing to the app.
                You can share a photo with a group of up to 50 friends, and they can add stickers and text, draw, and
                even copy and paste portions of other pictures onto it (such as adding people or pets to your photo).

            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">

                Adobe Photoshop Express is an excellent free photo editor for desktops and mobile devices.


                It looks as smart as any Adobe product â€“ beautifully designed, with clear icons and uncluttered menus.
            </p>
            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                When you first open PicsArt, the visually busy community home page is displayed, and it might take a few
                moments for a new user to wade through all the buttons to figure out what to do first.
            </p>
            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                Tools are split into two categories: Edit and Decorate. The first of these includes standard options
                like saturation adjustment, cropping, resizing and white balance. There are also some more advanced and
                unusual tools that you won't find in most online photo editors, including an excellent fill light option
                for reducing harsh shadows and an auto correct setting that suggests various quick adjustments to your
                image's colors, which you can apply with a single click.
            </p>
            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                The decorate option is less practical and more fun, offering a set of WhatsApp-style stickers for
                customizing your photos before sharing them on social media. You can't edit the text on decorations, but
                you can resize, reposition, rotate and adjust their opacity.

            </p>
            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                Once you've finished, Photoshop Express Editor lets you save the edited photo to your device. The only
                format available is JPG, and it's a pity there's no option to send the file directly to Twitter or
                Facebook â€“ particularly since the decorations seem to lend themselves to use on social media â€“ but you
                can choose a file name and destination, and the editor lets you know the size of the exported file
                before you commit to saving it.

                <img src="glog/cc.png" alt="" class="thumb_img mt-5" data-aos="flip-up">

            </h3>
            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">

                Adobe software is often used by professionals for graphic design and other media creation professions to
                great effect. Adobe has added most of their most popular software to the Play Store as mobile-optimized
                applications for on-the-go productivity. The newest member of the Adobe mobile suite is Comp CC, an all
                new app that eases the editing load on the go.
            </p>
            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                Comp CC is, essentially, a wire-frame and concept creation tool for exporting into other Adobe software
                for refinement. It has preconfigured templates for web, paper, and mobile layouts that you can edit and
                export to InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator as well as Adobeâ€™s cloud where you can pull it down to any
                machine you wish.

            </p>
            <p class="primary-text mt-5 mb-5">
                The idea behind Comp appears to be that itâ€™s something to get you started on a project, lay out a plan
                while on the go without having to use draft paper or lose progress by starting over on your main editing
                machine. Itâ€™s almost like a draft program but lets you get real progress on what would eventually become
                a more complex design for a web page, magazine, business card or what have you.
